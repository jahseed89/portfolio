            <p>
              Hello again! Thanks for scrolling this far! I graduated from the
              Federal University of Agriculture with a Bachelors of Engineering
              in Agricultural Engineering. I ventured into Product Design in
              2021 and have handled quite a few challenging but exciting design
              projects with (2) of my designs presently in development stage.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other than design, I spend most of my free time learning about
              design, watching psychological thrillers or comedy series and
              football - an ardent Arsenal FC supporter here.ðŸ˜Ž Iâ€˜ve also been
              trying to read more so feel free to reach out to me with any book
              recommendations!
            </p>
