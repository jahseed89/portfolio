            <p>
              I currently work as a Product (UI/UX) Designer at Lights on
              Heights, where I collaborate with engineers and product managers
              to create, and develop solutions that solve business problems and
              attract customers through a well thought out design process.
            </p>
            <p>
              I previously worked as a Product Designer at Impero Techne Limited
              and Visual Design Intern at Devcent. These experiences have helped
              shaped the way I approach design solutions and given me the
              capacity to blend both customer needs and business objectives
              together to create better digital solutions.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              I help brands convey succinct visuals and experiences to their
              target customers through user-centred design approach while
              ensuring business goals align with user needs.
